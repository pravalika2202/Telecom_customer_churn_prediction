# Telecom_customer_churn_prediction
I will be analyzing churn trends, customer preferences, and service profitability. This includes churn percentage, patterns by gender and service type, and the most profitable features. I’ll also explore trends, contract impact, and correlations between service add-ons and churn.


## **Problem Statement**  
The Retention department at telecome company, a telecom provider, is concerned about customer churn and seeks to identify at-risk customers. To address this, the engagement partner has requested the following tasks:  

- Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to customer retention.  
- Develop a dashboard for the retention manager that provides insights into these KPIs.  
- Summarize findings in a concise email to the engagement partner, including actionable recommendations for improvement.  

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn at a company using a dataset taken from kaggle. The goal is to uncover key factors that influence retention and churn, allowing the company to make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. A comprehensive dashboard has been developed to visualize critical KPIs, offering valuable insights into customer behavior and service preferences.  

## Key Skills Utilized
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated measures.  
- Pythona nd power query editor :for cleaning the dataset and understanding the key information
- Data Analysis:Understanding the dataset and identifying significant KPIs.  

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes customer attributes such as service subscriptions, account details, demographic information, and support history. These variables provide a rich foundation for analyzing customer engagement and retention trends.  

## Key Insights  

1. Customer Retention & Churn:Telecome company now has a total customer base of 7,043, with a churn rate of 26%, indicating a 74% retention rate. While this suggests a generally effective retention strategy, further improvements can be made.  

2. Service Adoption Trends: Phone services have the highest adoption rate (90.32%), making them the company’s core offering. Internet services follow closely at 78.33%. However, features like Online Security, Tech Support, and Device Protection have lower adoption rates, presenting an opportunity for targeted marketing efforts.  

3. Revenue Insights:The top 10 highest-paying customers collectively contribute over $85K to revenue. Ensuring their continued satisfaction is crucial to maintaining a steady revenue stream.  

4. Billing & Payment Preferences:Around 30% of customers prefer electronic checks, making it the most popular payment method, followed by credit cards. Understanding these preferences can help optimize payment processing strategies.  

5. Churn & Customer Tenure:The average customer tenure is 17.98 months. Churned customers tend to have a shorter tenure, highlighting the need for stronger engagement strategies within the first 18 months to improve retention.  

6. Impact of Contract Type on Churn:Month-to-month contracts account for 23.5% of customers, yet this group exhibits the highest churn rate. Offering incentives to transition them to long-term contracts could help reduce churn.  

7. Customer Support & Churn:Customers with more tech support interactions tend to churn more frequently, suggesting dissatisfaction with service resolution. Enhancing customer support efficiency could improve retention.  

8. Effect of Monthly Charges:Customers paying above $70 per month exhibit the highest churn, whereas those charged under $60 are easier to retain. Adjusting pricing strategies or providing additional value for higher-paying customers may help reduce churn.  

9. Senior Citizens’ Revenue Contribution:Although seniors make up 16.21% of the customer base, they contribute $3.21 million in revenue, demonstrating a high engagement with premium services. They also show a strong preference for paperless billing. Enhancing digital engagement and personalized offerings for this segment could boost retention and revenue.  

10. Churn by Service Type:Fiber Optic customers have higher tech support interactions. Reducing the average tech support tickets per customer to 0.5 could enhance their experience and reduce churn.
